* Analyzed major operational inefficiencies at the XYZ Products Division and built advanced demand-forecasting models (Exponential Smoothing, Brown’s DES, Seasonality & Regression) to accurately predict product demand for the next five weeks.
* Developed complete operations planning components including Aggregate Planning, MPS, MRP, Capacity Planning, and Scheduling, aligning production with BOMs, capacity limits, and cost constraints.
* Built simulation models in ProModel to optimize machine utilization, reduce idle time, identify bottlenecks, and validate scheduling rules (FIFO, LIFO, priority-based).
* Delivered a data-driven strategy to reduce backorders, cut WIP inventory, optimize production cost, and improve workforce/machine utilization, strengthening profitability and operational stability for the division.
